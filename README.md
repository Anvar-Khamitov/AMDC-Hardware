# Advanced Motor Drive Controller (AMDC)

This project was developed by Nathan Petersen during Spring 2018 for Eric Severson.

## Background

AMDC is a PCB that acts as a carrier card for a PicoZed SoM. AMDC provides useful interfaces which can be used to control power electronics.

These interfaces include:
- 48 digital outout channels for driving 8 full inverters
- 16 analog input channels
- 24 channel general purpose I/O
- Quadrature encoder input
